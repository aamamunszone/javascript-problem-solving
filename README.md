# JavaScript Basic Problem Solving

This repository contains my solutions to 10 fundamental JavaScript coding problems. These tasks demonstrate basic logic, array manipulation, string handling, and loops using plain JavaScript.

## 📺 Video Explanation

I have recorded a video explaining the logic for 5 selected problems (Palindrome, Remove Duplicates, Capitalize Words, Factorial, and PingPong).

## 🚀 Problems and Solutions

### 1. Reverse a String

**Logic:** Converts the string into an array, reverses the order, and joins it back.

- **File:** `problem-01.js`

### 2. Count Vowels

**Logic:** Iterates through the string and checks if each character exists in a predefined list of vowels (a, e, i, o, u).

- **File:** `problem-02.js`

### 3. Check for Palindrome

**Logic:** Compares the original string with its reversed version to check if they are identical.

- **File:** `problem-03.js`

### 4. Find the Maximum Number

**Logic:** Loops through the array and maintains a `max` variable that updates whenever a larger number is found.

- **File:** `problem-04.js`

### 5. Remove Duplicates from an Array

**Logic:** Uses a new array and checks if an element already exists before adding it to ensure uniqueness.

- **File:** `problem-05.js`

### 6. Sum of All Numbers in an Array

**Logic:** Uses a loop to add every number in the array to a total `sum` variable.

- **File:** `problem-06.js`

### 7. Find Even Numbers in an Array

**Logic:** Uses the modulo operator `%` to filter numbers that are divisible by 2.

- **File:** `problem-07.js`

### 8. Capitalize First Letter of Each Word

**Logic:** Splits the sentence into words, capitalizes the first character of each word, and joins them back.

- **File:** `problem-08.js`

### 9. Find the Factorial of a Number

**Logic:** Multiplies a sequence of descending natural numbers using a `for` loop.

- **File:** `problem-09.js`

### 10. PingPong Challenge

**Logic:** Iterates from 1 to 20 and applies conditional logic to print "Ping", "Pong", or "PingPong" based on multiples of 3 and 5.

- **File:** `problem-10.js`
